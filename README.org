* Scribe
This is a simple web app collection consisting of two tools that simplify workflows for those working with academic catalogs and Ellucian Scribe.

There are two primary tools:

1. catparse: a tool to convert a course list into scribe class rules
2. concdiff: a tool to assist with determining core and concentration courses from two course lists--utilizing set operations.

Both tools are simple, minimalist flask applications.
